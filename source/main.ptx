        <title>Description of functions</title>
        <p>
           A <em>relation</em> is a collection of pairs. 
    <example>
<m>\{(1,x),(3,t),(1,y),(4,y)\}</m>
 is a relation.
</example>

The set of all first entries of the pairs in a relation is
    called the <em>domain</em>, and the set of all second entries 
    is called the <em>range</em>. We will denote them by <m>D</m> and <m>R</m>, respectively.
 <example> 
    <ol marker="a">
    <li>
    The relation <m>\{(1,x),(3,t),(1,y),(4,y)\}</m>
    has domain 
    <m>D=\{ 1,3,4\}</m> and range <m>R=\{x,t,y\}</m> 
    (remember that
  when listing the elements of a set, we never repeat the same element twice).
   </li>   
    <li>
The relation <m> \{(0,c),(1,d),(2,c),(3,e),(4,a),(5,f)\}</m> has
domain
<m>D=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}</m> and range <m>R=\{a,c,d,e,f\}</m> 
</li>
<li>
The relation <m>\{ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (2,1)\}</m> has domain <m>D=\{1,2,3\}</m>
and range <m>R=\{1\}</m>.
</li></ol>
  </example>
  </p>
  <p>
Note that in part a. of the last example, we can find
two pairs that have the same first entry,    
but different second entries: <m>(1,x)</m> and <m>(1,y)</m>.
But this is not the case for parts b. and c. In these relations, 
for every element of the domain,
there is only one element of the range that is paired with it.
So we can think of the relations in b. and c. as <em>rules</em>: 
if we are given the first entry, we can determine the second one.
Such relations are called <em>functions</em>.
</p>
<p>
               <definition>
A <em>function</em> <m>f</m> from a set <m>A</m> to a set <m>B</m> 
is a relation that provides a rule for matching each element of the domain <m>A</m>
 with exactly one element of the range <m>B</m>.
</definition>
</p>
<p>
So relations b. and c. in the last example are functions, but a. is not.
Note that in part c. we had the two identical pairs <m>(2,1)</m> and <m>(2,1)</m>. 
This is OK for a function, because even though the first entries are the same, 
so are the second entries. We are just 
repeating twice the same rule: given <m>2</m>, we get <m>1</m>.
</p>
<subsection>
  <title> Functions from diagrams</title>
  <p>
    Since a function pairs  each element of the domain with  <b>only one</b>  element of the range,
    we can picture it by drawing an arrow from each element of the domain to the
    corresponding entry of the range, as in the following diagram:   
<figure>
<caption>A function with domain <m>D=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}</m>  
and range <m>R=\{a,c,d,e,f\}</m></caption>
<image source="U1F1.jpg" width="60%"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
Note that the element <m>b</m> in the previous diagram
is not in the range, because there is no element of the domain that is paired with it. 
    
    The essential thing about a function is that it sends each element of the domain to  
    a <alert>unique</alert> element of the range. So we cannot have one
element of the domain sent to two different elements of the range. But it is OK to 
    have two or more elements of the domain sent
to the same element of the range (like the element <m>c</m> in the figure above).
</p>
<p>
    To remember this, think of the domain of a function as a set of people, and the range as a 
    set of birthdays.
Each person must have a unique  birthday (a person cannot be born twice!) but it is 
    of course OK to have two people with the same birthday.
</p>
<p>
An element of the domain is also called an <em>input</em> value, and an element of the range an
<em>output</em> value.

          </p>
      </subsection>


<subsection>
  <title>Functions from tables</title>
  <p>
A common way to describe a function is to make a table that lists the domain elements in a 
row, with the corresponding range elements below, as in the following example.
</p>
<p>
<example> The following table describes a function with domain <m>D=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> and range <m>R=\{0,1,4,5,8\}</m>.

<tabular halign="center">
    <row header="yes" bottom="minor" >
      <cell right="minor"> <m>x</m></cell>
      <cell> <m>1</m></cell>
      <cell> <m>2</m></cell>
      <cell> <m>3</m></cell>
      <cell><m>4</m></cell>
      <cell><m>5</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell right="minor"> <m>y</m></cell>
      <cell> <m>8</m></cell>
      <cell> <m>5</m></cell>
      <cell><m>4</m></cell>
      <cell><m>1</m></cell>
      <cell> <m>0</m></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
</example>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it may be more convenient to list the elements as columns instead of rows, 
with the domain elements on the left. So the function of the previous example would be:
<tabular halign="center">
  <row bottom="minor">
    <cell right="minor"><m>x</m> </cell><cell><m>y</m> </cell>
  </row>
  <row >
    <cell right="minor"><m>1</m> </cell><cell><m>8</m> </cell>
  </row>
  <row >
    <cell right="minor"><m>2</m> </cell><cell><m>5</m> </cell>
  </row>
  <row >
    <cell right="minor"><m>3</m> </cell><cell><m>4</m> </cell>
  </row>
  <row >
    <cell right="minor"><m>4</m> </cell><cell><m>1</m> </cell>
  </row>
  <row >
    <cell right="minor"><m>5</m> </cell><cell><m>0</m> </cell>
  </row>
</tabular>
</p>

  <title>Square roots and cube roots</title>

<p>
If we square <m>3</m>, we get <m>3^2=9</m>, and so we often say <q>The square root of <m>9</m> is <m>3</m></q>.
But this isn't quite right, because if we square <m>-3</m> we get <m>9</m> as well: <m>(-3)^2=9</m>. So to be
precise we should say <q><alert>A</alert> square root of <m>9</m> is <m>3</m> (and another one is <m>-3</m>)</q> 
</p>
<p> 
This leads us to conclude that there are
two square roots of <m>9</m>, that is, <m>3</m> and <m>-3</m>, often written as <m>\pm 3</m>. This
means that there are two solutions of 
the equation <m>x^2=9</m>
and that is, <m>x=\pm 3</m>. BUT, we should not confuse this with the symbol <m>\sqrt{9}</m>. When 
we write <m>\sqrt{9}</m> we mean the <alert>positive</alert> square root of 9. So, <m>\sqrt{9}=3</m>, while the solutions
of the equation <m>x^2=9</m> are <m>\pm \sqrt{9}</m>, or <m>\pm 3</m>. 
</p>
<p>
<example>
Suppose we want to solve the equation <m>x^2-4y-1=0</m> for <m>x</m>.
<tabular>
  <row>
    <cell halign="right"><m>x^2-4y-1</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell> <cell> <m>0</m> </cell> <cell> The given equation</cell>
  </row>
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>x^2-4y-1 {\color{red}{+4y+1}}</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>0{\color{red}{+4y+1}}</m></cell><cell> add <m>4y+1</m> to both sides</cell>
</row> 
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>x^2</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>4y+1</m></cell><cell> simplify</cell>
</row>
<row>
  <cell  halign="right"><m>x</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>\pm \sqrt{4y+1}</m></cell><cell> take square root, with <m>\pm </m> sign.</cell>
</row>
</tabular>

So we find two solutions, <m>x=\pm \sqrt{4y+1}</m>.
</example>
</p>

<p>
  Because the square of a negative number is positive, and the square of a positive number is positive, we can
never get a negative number by squaring <alert>any</alert> real number. So for example the equation <m>x^2+4=0</m>
has no solutions, because if we try to solve it we get <m>x=\pm \sqrt{-4}</m>, and that is not a real number. 
</p>
<p>
  For cube roots, things are different. That's because if <m>x</m> is negative, then <m>x^3</m> is also negative. So for
example <m>(-2)^3=-8</m>. This means that the solution of <m>x^3=8</m> is just <m>x=2</m>, and the solution of <m>x^3=-8</m> is 
<m>x=-2</m>. Compare with the situation for squares: <m>x^2=9</m> has two solutions, and <m>x^2=-9</m> has no solutions. 

</p>

<p>
  
<example>
Consider the equation <m>u^3+27w=0</m>. We want to solve this equation for <m>u</m>. 
<tabular>
  <row>
    <cell halign="right"><m>u^3+27w</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell> <cell> <m>0</m> </cell> <cell> The given equation</cell>
  </row>
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>u^3+27w \color{red}{-27w}</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>0 \color{red}{-27w}</m></cell><cell> 
  subtract <m>27w</m> from both sides</cell>
</row> 
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>u^3</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>-27w</m></cell><cell> simplify</cell>
</row>
<row>
  <cell  halign="right"><m>u</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m> \sqrt[3]{-27w}</m></cell><cell> take cube root, 
  <alert>without</alert> <m>\pm </m> sign</cell>
</row>
<row>
  <cell  halign="right"><m>u</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m> -3\sqrt[3]{w}</m></cell><cell> simplify</cell>
</row>
</tabular>
This time we found only one solution, <m>u=-3\sqrt[3]{w}</m>.
</example>
</p>
<p>
  
For higher exponents, such as <m>x^4</m>, <m>x^5</m>, etc, we just need to consider whether the exponent is even 
or odd. So for example <m>x^4 = 3</m> has two solutions, <m>x=\pm \sqrt[4]{3}</m>, and <m>x^4=-3</m> has no solutions, while
<m>x^5=3</m> has one solution <m>x=\sqrt[5]{3}</m> and <m>x^5=-3</m> has one solution <m>x=-\sqrt[5]{3}</m>.

<subsection>
  <title>Functions from equations</title>
  <p>
Suppose we are given an equation in two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, such as <m>y-3x^2=0</m>.
If we solve it for <m>y</m>, we find a single answer:
<tabular>
  <row>
    <cell halign="right"><m>y-3x^2</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell> <cell> <m>0</m> </cell> <cell> The given equation</cell>
  </row>
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>y-3x^2 \color{red}{+3x^2}</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>0 \color{red}{+3x^2}</m></cell><cell> 
  add <m>3x^2</m> to both sides</cell>
</row> 
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>y</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>3x^2</m></cell><cell> simplify</cell>
</row>
</tabular>
In this case we say that the given equation <em>defines <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m></em>,
and we call <m>x</m> the <em>independent variable</em>, and <m>y</m> the <em>dependent variable</em>. 
  </p>
<p>
That's because if we choose any value we want for <m>x</m>, such as <m>x=2</m>, then the formula
<m>y=3x^2</m> allows us to find <m>y</m>:
<me>y=3(2^2)=3(4)=12.</me>
So the independent variable
is for the input of the function (in the domain), and the dependent variable for the output
(in the range).
</p>

<p>
But suppose we solve instead the same equation for <m>x</m>:
<tabular>
  <row>
    <cell halign="right"><m>y-3x^2</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell> <cell> <m>0</m> </cell> <cell> The given equation</cell>
  </row>
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>y-3x^2 \color{red}{-y}</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>0 \color{red}{-y}</m></cell><cell> 
  add <m>3x^2</m> to both sides</cell>
</row> 
<row>
  <cell halign="right"><m>-3x^2</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>-y</m></cell><cell> simplify</cell>
</row>
<row>
  <cell  halign="right"><m>x^2</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m>\displaystyle \frac{y}{3}</m></cell><cell> divide both sides by <m>-3</m></cell>
</row>
<row>
  <cell  halign="right"><m>x</m></cell><cell><m>=</m></cell><cell><m> \displaystyle \pm \sqrt{\frac{y}{3}}</m></cell><cell> take square root,
  with <m>\pm</m> sign</cell>
</row>
</tabular>
</p>
<p>
  This time we found two answers for a given value of <m>y</m>: either <m>\sqrt{y/3}</m>, or <m>-\sqrt{y/3}</m>. 
This is like a person having two birthdays. It means that the equation does <alert>not</alert>
define <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m>.
</p>
<p>
While the most common name for the input variable is <m>x</m>, and the most common name for the output
variable is <m>y</m>, it is important to bear in mind that any names can be used for either variable. So 
it is quite possible to have an equation that determines <m>x</m> as a function of <m>y</m> (see for example Problem 1.1.3).
</p>
