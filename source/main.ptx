        <title>Description of functions</title>
        <p>
           A <em>relation</em> is a collection of pairs. 
    <example>
<m>\{(1,x),(3,t),(1,y),(4,y)\}</m>
 is a relation.
</example>

The set of all first entries of the pairs in a relation is
    called the <em>domain</em>, and the set of all second entries 
    is called the <em>range</em>. We will denote them by <m>D</m> and <m>R</m>, respectively.
 <example> 
    <ol marker="a">
    <li>
    The relation <m>\{(1,x),(3,t),(1,y),(4,y)\}</m>
    has domain 
    <m>D=\{ 1,3,4\}</m> and range <m>R=\{x,t,y\}</m> 
    (remember that
  when listing the elements of a set, we never repeat the same element twice).
   </li>   
    <li>
The relation <m> \{(0,c),(1,d),(2,c),(3,e),(4,a),(5,f)\}</m> has
domain
<m>D=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}</m> and range <m>R=\{a,c,d,e,f\}</m> 
</li>
<li>
The relation <m>\{ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (2,1)\}</m> has domain <m>D=\{1,2,3\}</m>
and range <m>R=\{1\}</m>.
</li></ol>
  </example>
Note that in part a. of the previous example, we can find
two pairs that have the same first entry, 
but different second entries: <m>(1,x)</m> and <m>(1,y)</m>.
But this is not the case for parts b. and c. In these relations, 
for every element of the domain,
there is only one element of the range that is paired with it.
So we can think of the relations in b. and c. as <em>rules</em>: 
if we are given the first entry, we can determine the second one.
Such relations are called <em>functions</em>.
               <definition>
A <em>function</em> <m>f</m> from a set <m>A</m> to a set <m>B</m> 
is a relation that provides a rule for matching each element of the domain <m>A</m>
 with exactly one element of the range <m>B</m>.
</definition>
So relations b. and c. in the last example are functions, but a. is not.
Note that in part c. we had the two identical pairs <m>(2,1)</m> and <m>(2,1)</m>. 
This is OK for a function, because even though the first entries are the same, 
so are the second entries. We are just 
repeating twice the same rule: given <m>2</m>, we get <m>1</m>.
</p>
<subsection>
  <title> Functions from diagrams</title>
  <p>
    Since a function pairs  each element of the domain with  <b>only one</b>  element of the range,
    we can picture it by drawing an arrow from each element of the domain to the
    corresponding entry of the range, as in the following diagram:   
<figure>
<caption>A function with domain <m>D=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}</m>  
and range <m>R=\{a,c,d,e,f\}</m></caption>
<image source="U1F1.jpg" width="60%"/>
</figure>

Note that the element <m>b</m> in the previous diagram
is not in the range, because there is no element of the domain that is paired with it. 
    
    The essential thing about a function is that it sends each element of the domain to  
    a <alert>unique</alert> element of the range. So we cannot have one
element of the domain sent to two different elements of the range. But it is OK to 
    have two or more elements of the domain sent
to the same element of the range (like the element <m>c</m> in the figure above).
</p>
<p>
    To remember this, think of the domain of a function as a set of people, and the range as a 
    set of birthdays.
Each person must have a unique  birthday (a person cannot be born twice!) but it is 
    of course OK to have two people with the same birthday.
